  abstract = {Statistical Analysis of Management Data provides a comprehensive approach to multivariate statistical analyses that are important for researchers in all fields of management, including finance, production, accounting, marketing, strategy, technology, and human resources. This book is especially designed to provide doctoral students with a theoretical knowledge of the concepts underlying the most important multivariate techniques and an overview of actual applications. It offers a clear, succinct exposition of each technique with emphasis on when each technique is appropriate and how to use it. This third edition, fully revised, updated, and expanded, reflects the most current evolution in the methods for data analysis in management and the social sciences. In particular, this edition includes: {$\cdot$} A new chapter on the analysis of mediation and moderation effects {$\cdot$} Examples using STATA for most of the statistical methods {$\cdot$} Example of XLSTAT applications Featuring numerous examples, the book may serve as an advanced text or as a resource for applied researchers in industry who want to understand the foundations of the methods particularly relevant and typically used in management research, and to learn how they can be applied using widely available statistical software},

  abstract = {The authors present tools and concepts of multivariate data analysis by means of exercises and their solutions. The first part is devoted to graphical techniques. The second part deals with multivariate random variables and presents the derivation of estimators and tests for various practical situations. The last part introduces a wide variety of exercises in applied multivariate data analysis. The book demonstrates the application of simple calculus and basic multivariate methods in real life situations. It contains altogether more than 250 solved exercises which can assist a university teacher in setting up a modern multivariate analysis course. All computer-based exercises are available in the R language. All R codes and data sets may be downloaded via the quantlet download center www.quantlet.org or via the Springer webpage.

  abstract = {Discovering knowledge from big multivariate data, recorded every days, requires specialized machine learning techniques.This book presents an easy to use practical guide in R to compute the most popular machine learning methods for exploring real word data sets, as well as, for building predictive models.     The main parts of the book include: A) Unsupervised learning methods, to explore and discover knowledge from a large multivariate data set using clustering and principal component methods. You will learn hierarchical clustering, k-means, principal component analysis and correspondence analysis methods. B) Regression analysis, to predict a quantitative outcome value using linear regression and non-linear regression strategies. C) Classification techniques, to predict a qualitative outcome value using logistic regression, discriminant analysis, naive bayes classifier and support vector machines. D) Advanced machine learning methods, to build robust regression and classification models using k-nearest neighbors methods, decision tree models, ensemble methods (bagging, random forest and boosting). E) Model selection methods, to select automatically the best combination of predictor variables for building an optimal predictive model. These include, best subsets selection methods, stepwise regression and penalized regression (ridge, lasso and elastic net regression models). We also present principal component-based regression methods, which are useful when the data contain multiple correlated predictor variables. F) Model validation and evaluation techniques for measuring the performance of a predictive model. G) Model diagnostics for detecting and fixing a potential problems in a predictive model.     The book presents the basic principles of these tasks and provide many examples in R. This book offers solid guidance in data mining for students and researchers.    Key features:   Covers machine learning algorithm and implementationKey mathematical concepts are presentedShort, self-contained chapters with practical examples.},

Although we can construct an asymptotically normal estimator of the ruin probability from the claim data, the asymptotic variance is not easy to estimate since it includes the derivative of the ruin probability with respect to the parameter. This paper gives an explicit asymptotic formula for the asymptotic variance, which is easy to estimate, and gives an asymptotic confidence interval of ruin probability.},
